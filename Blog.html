          <p class="note">
            Five years ago, I felt lost. I switched industries and roles a few times (from finance to media, from stock analyst to content manager), but nothing stuck. I decided to take an entry-level contractor job at Facebook while I studied for the GRE and applied to graduate school. <br><br>

Once I was at Facebook, everything clicked. I loved working in an engineering-driven culture, I thrived working cross-functionally and rallying team members around a common goal. I knew in my first six months, that I wanted to be a Product Manager (PM). It would take me about five years, I’d fail my first PM interview, but eventually, I got there. <br><br>

Below, is my journey of going from an entry-level contractor to a Product Manager at Facebook. I’ll talk about what I did at each step, what I learned, and how it brought me closer to my goal. <br><br>

<strong>Data Labeler (6 months): Flawless Execution</strong> <br>
I moved to California to take a three-month entry-level contractor role at Facebook. Contractor roles tend to be for a set time span, and lack the benefits of being a full-time employee (Healthcare, stock options, PTO, etc.). The role was itself tedious. I answered ‘yes/no’ questions for thousands of pieces of content. The work wasn’t thrilling but I took it seriously and executed it quickly. When I finished I asked for more challenging work. Doing the first let people know I was capable and willing to work on something at 100% even if I felt it was a menial task. Doing the second showed I was hungry to learn and opened the door for new opportunities. <br><br>

The projects thrown my way were team-level process improvements. Working on this allowed me to work side-by-side with my manager, and learn her priorities. This helped me identify new opportunities where I could lean in. <br><br>

<strong>To summarize: Take tasks seriously and execute flawlessly!</strong> <br><br>

<strong>Data Specialist (1.5 years): Become Invaluable</strong> <br>
After six months, a full-time position opened on my team. I interviewed for the role and landed it. I was already doing the job since I was asking for more challenging work, which made it a lot easier. I followed the same playbook I had as a contractor. I executed well on any task and then asked for more challenging work. <br><br>

A key thing in this stage was becoming invaluable by figuring out and managing work no one else wanted to take on. For my team, it meant figuring out timelines on complex data labeling work. The labeling took longer than expected because we didn’t have sound capacity plans in place. Once I figured out a system to make project timelines, I became invaluable to my Engineering Manager. He was on the hook for reporting timelines upwards to our Product Director. <br><br>

<strong>To Summarize: Become invaluable</strong> <br><br>

<strong>Transition to Technical Program Manager (TPM): When you encounter a roadblock, find an alternate route.</strong> <br><br>

After two years as a Data Specialist, I was ready for a new challenge. I wanted to be a Product Manager, but I was still in an entry-level role with no Product Management experience under my belt. Luckily, Facebook had a Rotational Product Manager Program geared towards entry-level Product Managers. This was perfect for me! I had an interview scheduled, I practiced many questions, and on the day of I completely froze. I couldn’t connect the problems I practiced to what the interviewer was asking me. A recruiter called me the next week and confirmed this. I felt embarrassed. I had a lot of help practicing, I felt I had not only let those folks down but myself down too. I wanted to bury my head in the sand, but I resolved to be flexible, and think of other ways to get PM experience. <br><br>

The two key interview loops for a PM are Product Sense and Execution. I needed to get more experience in these two areas so I could hone these skills and be more prepared the next time. There was another role at Facebook called ‘Technical Program Manager’. This role had a heavy execution focus and some exposure to Product Strategy. As s a plus the role would allow me to deepen my technical knowledge. <br><br>

My current team had an opening for a Technical Program Manager role. I interviewed for the role and succeeded. <br><br>

To Summarize: Be flexible, find an alternate route if the first one doesn’t work out. <br><br>
